    Agriculture marketing involves the activities and processes used to bring agricultural products from the farm to the consumer. Kyanja Agricultural Resource Center Uganda, located in Kampala's Kawempe Division, plays a pivotal role in this process. 

    Established by the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) in 2013, Kyanja Agricultural Resource Center spans a 30-acre facility. It has emerged as a thriving hub, promoting sustainable agriculture and addressing critical issues such as income generation and food security. The center is designed to enhance market access for farmers, securing better investments in agriculture to improve outcomes, particularly for smallholder farmers.

    At Kyanja, farmers can connect directly with markets, ensuring fair pricing and consistent demand for their produce. This approach guarantees equitable, sustainable, and high-quality farm products for all Ugandans and even extends to neighboring countries. From fresh fruits, vegetables, and grains to innovative agricultural practices, Kyanja is redefining the way agricultural marketing works. 

    With year-round training, events, and access to resources, the center empowers farmers with the tools they need to thrive. Kyanja Agricultural Resource Center is not just a marketplace; itâ€™s a community dedicated to transforming agriculture for a brighter, sustainable future.
